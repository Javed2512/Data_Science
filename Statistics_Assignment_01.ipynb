    "Q2) Define different type of Statistics and give example of when each type might be used?\n",
    "Ans) There are two types of Statistics:\n",
    "(I) Descriptive statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the summarization, presentation, and analysis of data.\n",
    "The goal of descriptive statistics is to describe the data and its properties using numerical measures and graphs.\n",
    "For example, a marketing company may use descriptive statistics to analyze the sales data of a particular product to determine\n",
    "the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation of the sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "(II) Inferential statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making predictions and drawing conclusions about a population\n",
    "based on a sample.The goal of inferential statistics is to generalize the results obtained from the sample to the larger\n",
    "population.\n",
    "For example, a political exitpoll may use inferential statistics to predict the outcome of an election by surveying a sample \n",
    "of voters."

    "    course ratings (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, etc.).\n",

    "Ans)Descriptive statistics refers to the statistical methods used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset.\n",
    "It involves calculating and presenting summary measures such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures\n",
    "of variability (range, standard deviation, variance). Descriptive statistics are useful for providing an overview of the dataset\n",
    "and identifying patterns and trends in the data.\n",
    "For example, suppose we collect data on the heights of 100 students in a class. We can use descriptive statistics to calculate\n",
    "the mean height, the standard deviation of height, and the range of height values in the dataset. These descriptive statistics\n",
    "provide an overview of the distribution of heights and help us understand the central tendency and variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, refers to the statistical methods used to draw conclusions or make predictions about\n",
    "a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics involve making inferences about the population \n",
    "parameters (e.g., mean, variance, proportion) based on the sample statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, proportion).\n",
    "Inferential statistics are useful for testing hypotheses, making predictions, and generalizing the findings from a sample\n",
    "to the larger population.\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to know whether the average height of students in a class is different from the average height \n",
    "of students in the whole school. We can use inferential statistics to test the hypothesis that there is a significant \n",
    "difference between the means of the two groups. We can use a t-test to determine whether the difference between the means \n",

    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "Ans)The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme\n",
    "values, so it may not accurately represent the center of the data if the dataset contains outliers. The mean is useful for data \n",
    "that is normally distributed or has a symmetrical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean,\n",
    "and it is useful for data with a skewed distribution. The median is often used for ordinal data or continuous data that cannot\n",
    "be measured precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. The mode is useful for data with a discrete distribution, and it\n",
    "is often used for nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of variability describe the spread or dispersion of the data. The two most commonly used measures of variability are\n",
    "the range and the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range provides a rough estimate of the\n",
    "dispersion of the data, but it is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. It measures how far the data is \n",
    "from the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data is clustered around the mean, while a high standard deviation\n",
    "indicates that the data is more spread out. The standard deviation is useful for data with a normal distribution."
