    "    Inheritance\n",
    "    ● Inheritance is a powerful feature in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "    ● Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.\n",
    "      With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.\n",
    "    ● The class which inherits the properties of the other is known as subclass (derived class or child class) and the class \n",
    "      whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).\n",
    "    \n",
    "(i)Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "    ● A class can be inherited from more than one superclass in Python, similar to C++. This is called multiple inheritance.\n",
    "    ● In multiple inheritance, the features of all the superclasses are inherited into the subclass. The syntax for multiple\n",
    "      inheritance is similar to single inheritance.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
