    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans)A database is a collection of structured data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to store, manage, and retrieve\n",
    "information. It can be a physical or digital repository of data that is used to store and manage large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",

    "structured and rely on pre-defined schemas, while NoSQL databases are flexible and allow for a more dynamic and agile approach\n",
    "to data management. SQL databases are better suited for complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases excel at\n",

    "Ans)DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a subset of SQL that is used to define and manipulate the structure of a \n",

    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations of the commonly used DDL commands:\n",

    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure.\n",

    "DROP: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure.\n",
    "For example, to drop the \"customers\" table that was created in the previous example, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",

    "For example, to add a new column named \"address\" to the \"customers\" table created in the first example, the following SQL \n",
    "command can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data from a table without deleting the table structure. For example,\n",

    "DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations of the commonly used DML commands:\n",

    "UPDATE employees\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans)A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.\n",
    "A primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable. The values \n",
    "in a primary key column must be unique and cannot be NULL. Primary keys are often used as the basis for establishing \n",
    "relationships between tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"students\" with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", and \"class\". In this case, we can use \n",
    "the \"id\" column as the primary key since each student in the table can be uniquely identified by their ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key is \n",
    "used to establish a relationship between two tables in a database. The values in a foreign key column must match the values \n",
    "in the primary key column of the referenced table or be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider another table named \"courses\" with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"duration\", and \"student_id\". In this case\n",
    "the \"student_id\" column in the \"courses\" table can be used as a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the \"students\"\n",

    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "Ans)In an SQL query, the order of execution of SQL clauses is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) FROM: The FROM clause is used to specify the table(s) from which to retrieve data.\n",

    "3) WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter the data based on a condition.\n",

    "4) GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the data based on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped data based on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) LIMIT: The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that not all of these clauses are required in every SQL query. For example, a simple SELECT statement may\n",
    "only require the SELECT and FROM clauses, while a more complex query may require all of the above clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some databases may support additional clauses or variations of the above clauses. It's important to consult the \n",
